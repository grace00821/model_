# Unnamed App

### An integrated software to 1) empower the telemedicine consultation, 2) provide a long-term health monitoring and 3) log health data as a snapshot.

## Project management
### \> Framework: Vue.js
### \> UI library: Vuetify
### \> Package management: npm
### \> Code formatter: Prettier

## Some preliminary UX/UI design ideas:
### Users can login via accounts from other platforms, such as Google, Apple ID, eHealth, etc.
### There are four main pages in the App, users can switch pages by manipulating the bottom navigator.
### \> Page 1: Home page, which presents 1) some basic user's information and 2) a personalised information center, it can include reminders, notifications, suggestions, etc.
### \> Page 2: A chat system, which allows users to receive/reply messages from/to and send data to the healthcare provider, and interact with our chatbot.
### \> Page 3: Toolbox, the collection of software, such as ausculto. User can select to use a particular tool by clicking corresponding button from the list and entering the interface of the tool.
### \> Page 4: Setting (or it could be a page for storing/displaying all the data from the user, a diary, and the entry for Setting page can embedded into somewhere on the home page)
